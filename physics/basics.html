                       <p>Consider a boat before and after a stroke. Before the stroke, total momentum p = 0, since everything is at rest. After the stroke, total momentum must still equal zero because the total momentum can't change (Newton's 2nd Law).</p>

                       <div class="equation-box">

                           <h4>Example</h4>
                           <p>For a boat+crew mass m<sub>b</sub> = 100 kg (single sculler) to accelerate from rest to v<sub>b</sub> = 1 m/s, requires either:</p>
                           <ul>
                               <li>m<sub>w</sub> = 10 kg water accelerated to v<sub>w</sub> = 10 m/s, or</li>
                               <li>m<sub>w</sub> = 20 kg water accelerated to v<sub>w</sub> = 5 m/s</li>
                           </ul>
                           <p>Any combination where m<sub>w</sub>v<sub>w</sub> = m<sub>b</sub>v<sub>b</sub> = 100 kg⋅m/s works.</p>
                       </div>

                       <p>During the normal stroke with the boat already moving, it's less obvious that water moves backwards to keep the boat moving forwards since the blades appear to 'lock' where they're placed. However, if you look at the puddles when blades are extracted, it's clear that water is moved.</p>

                       <p><strong>There has to be some slippage to accelerate the boat</strong>, although from energy considerations this should be minimized.</p>

                       <p>Bodies moving in fluids slow down due to resistive forces known as <strong>drag</strong>. This represents a transfer of momentum from the body to the fluid: the surrounding fluid speeds up as the body slows down, maintaining constant total momentum.</p>

                       <p>If a crew (mass m<sub>c</sub>) sits still at backstops in a boat (mass m<sub>b</sub>) moving at velocity v<sub>t</sub>, the total momentum is (m<sub>c</sub> + m<sub>b</sub>)v<sub>t</sub>.</p>

                       <p>Consider rowing 1 minute at 4 m/s, then 1 minute at 6 m/s versus 2 minutes at constant 5 m/s. Both cover 600m total distance.</p>

                           <p><strong>Constant pace uses less average power (15% less in this example) to cover the same distance in the same time.</strong></p>
                           <p>It's more energy-efficient to maintain the same pace throughout a race rather than starting fast and slowing down, or starting slow and speeding up.</p>

                       <h3>Hull Speed Variation During Stroke</h3>

                       <p>The same principle applies to hull speed variation during each stroke. Since skin drag resistance depends on hull speed rather than center-of-mass speed, minimizing hull speed variation throughout the stroke is more efficient.</p>

                           <p><strong>Sliding Rigger Boats:</strong> These were banned because they reduced hull speed variation (sculler's seat fixed to hull, stretcher and riggers slide), making them theoretically more efficient. The theory presumably worked since they're now prohibited.</p>
